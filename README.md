# Walmart sales analysis
Forecasting is used to predict future conditions and make plans accordingly.Forecasting is used in many businesses and business manÂ­agement requires forecasting information when making a wide range of decisions.
In this project,we forecast sales of Walmart using machine learning in python.It is analyzed using multiple linear regression models to predict the future sales of the store.

The dataset used is [*Walmart Store Sales Forecasting*](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting) project that was available on Kaggle. In this dataset, we have weekly sales data for 45 stores and 99 departments for a period of 3 years. In addition, we had store and geography specific information such as store size, unemployment rate, temperature, promotional markdowns etc. Using these factors, we needed to develop a regression model that can forecast the sales and is also computationally efficient and scalable.
